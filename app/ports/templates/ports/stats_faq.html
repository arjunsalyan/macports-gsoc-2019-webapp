    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions - Statistics</h3>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <a name="collected-data"></a>
    <h4>Which Statistics Are Collected?</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>The MacPorts statistics collects and submits the following information to the server:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>A unique identifier for your MacPorts installation</strong><br/>
            This identifier is generated by <code>uuidgen</code> when you first
            install the statistics service. We use this identifier to overwrite
            statistics data you submitted earlier â€“ we keep at most one set of
            statistics per user per month. The identifier does not convey any
            information about your system or location.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Version numbers and system properties</strong><br/>
            The statistics service collects and submits the versions of MacPorts,
            OS X, GCC and Xcode installed on your system. It also tells us what
            your CPU architecture, platform and build target architecture are.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>A list of your installed ports</strong><br/>
            The statistics daemon collects and sends a list of the ports you have
            installed containing the following information for each port:
            <ul>
                <li>name and installed version</li>
                <li>whether the port is active or inactive</li>
                <li>chosen variants</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>How Often Are Statistics Sent?</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>The statistics daemon runs once a week, overwriting the data your installation did submit earlier in the same
        month, if any. If the daemon fails
        to send the data, the error is silently ignored.</p>

    <a name="why-statistics"></a>
    <h4>Why Do You Need Statistics?</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>We'd like to improve our understanding of how MacPorts and its ports are
        used. The statistics will help us determine which operating systems, build
        architectures and Xcode versions we need to support and test to provide
        a better overall experience for our users and less unexpected failures. The
        stats will also help us understand how quickly new MacPorts releases or port
        updates are adopted and how long we should wait before we can start using new
        features. The variant statistics will hopefully reveal ports where variants
        other than the default ones are popular choices and for which ports it might be
        advisable to test non-standard variants when updating a port, or even which
        variants should become defaults. We hope to use the variants data to build
        binary packages for non-default, but popular variants in the future.</p>

    <h4>How Can I Submit Statistics?</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>To start submitting statistics, install the <a href="https://github.com/macports/macports-ports/tree/master/sysutils/mpstats">mpstats</a> port in
        your MacPorts installation.</p>

    <a name="opt-out"></a>
    <h4>How Do I Stop Submitting Statistics?</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>Uninstalling the <a href="https://github.com/macports/macports-ports/tree/master/sysutils/mpstats">mpstats</a> port will prevent your system from
        submitting further statistics. Note that MacPorts will never default to
        submitting statistics. If you didn't explicitly <a href="#opt-in">opt-in</a>,
        MacPorts does not send statistics.</p>
